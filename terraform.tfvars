# q_cluster_name               - Name must be an alpha-numeric string between 2 and 15 characters. Dash (-) is allowed if not the first or last character. Must be unique per cluster.
# q_cluster_admin_password     - Minumum 8 characters and must include one each of: uppercase, lowercase, and a special character.  If replacing a cluster make sure this password matches current running cluster.
